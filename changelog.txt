- Added Projectile and Splat spell effects
- Refactored Actor class hierarchy
- Added Monster class

Version 2 - 06-Apr-2011
- Added tooltips for monsters
- Added hoverIntent library

Vection 3 - 07-Apr-2011
- ViewPort class (creating tiles, loading map tiles, larger map support, shifting map, more JQuery)
- Player now uses an instance of Actor

Version 4 - 09-Apr-2011
- More work on diagonal weirdness
- KeyDown movement now relies on Vector rather than directly manipulating CSS top/left properties.
- Added a couple new tiles
- changed viewport shift threshold to 1 to eliminate some weirdness
- Spells now use the Player as the source.

Version 5 - 03-Jul-2011
- Rewritten to support HTML5 and canvas drawing. Most of the JQuery is gone. Actually, most of the code is gone.
- Map now attempts to centre the player in the viewport after every move. This eliminates all the weird behaviour from the old algorithm.

Version 6 - 04-Jul-2011
- Sped up logging with JQuery and capped at 1000 lines to prevent performance issues with really big logs.
- Mouse handling routines added. Needs some refactoring.
- Click-and-drag functionality for player movement.
- Clicking for adjacent enemies to make a melee attack.
- Appears to possibly be a memory leak somewhere (FF5 grows large, IE9 and Chrome look fine... could just be that FF5 is shit)
- Upgraded JQuery library to 1.6.2 from 1.4.x (seems to have improved the FF5 memory issues) 

Version 7 - 05-Jul-2011
- HTML5 spell animation engine created.
- Class structure for spell effects created.
  - Added fading and fading+rotating effects for single point spells.
- Added splat animations for monster deaths.

Version 8 - 12-Sep-2011
- Projectile spell effect added.
- Improvements to animation queue to support chaining spell effects together.
- Fixed fade spell effect to prevent negative alpha.
- Test button for projectile spell test in all directions.

Version 9 - 13-Sep-2011
- Scaling and Area spell effects added
- Test button for Area effect added
- Burninate button added to target a tile by clicking.

Version 10 - 14-Sep-2011
- Refactored how ProjectileSpellEffect handles arriving at a target or encountering an obstacle.
- Added actions to spell animations allow spells to have consequences upon resolving.
- Refactored how Monsters are killed.
- Removed several unnecessary debug messages to reduce log clutter.
- Cleaned up process_click()
- Eliminated the remainder of the old JQuery spell system.

Version 11 - 15-Sep-2011
- Add splat_queue to animate splats after all other animations are completed.
- Made the main page less ugly.

Version 12 - 18-Sep-2011
- First version of new tooltips (overrides right-click events on the canvas only).

Version 13 - 19-Sep-2011
- Moved everything into a Git repository
- Cleaned up the tooltip code substantially.
- Preliminary work for enemy AI (monsters will move around randomly or stay put)
- Monsters could theoretically hit you if they get lucky but it doesn't do anything except trigger a poorly constructed sentence in the log.

Version 14 - 14-Oct-2011
- Bug fixes:
  - Random clicks no longer cause turns to occur
  - Tiles are no longer considered adjacent to themselves
- General
  - Melee events can have sources other than the Player
  - Updated melee combat resolution system so that it outputs some messages that are grammatically correct.
  - Added a method for determining line of sight
  - Tooltips will state that you cannot see a tile if it is not within line of sight (i.e. blocked by an obstacle)
  - Various other cleanups
  - Fixed some serious fuck-ups with dragging the Player around with the mouse which weren't immediately apparent until monsters started doing stuff
- Monsters:
  - Added Hill Giant (oh shit!)
- Enemy AI changes:
  - Monsters will use line of sight to determine if they can see you
  - Monsters will move to attack if you are within a certain distance (Rat Mans have bad eyes)
  - Monsters that don't have line of sight or are too far away from you have a 50% chance of just wandering around
  - Certain monsters can see far and have a chance of deciding to cast a spell at you rather than move
- Spell changes:
  - New method for calculating positioning for ProjectileSpellEffect
  - Spells can now have a source actor that is not the Player
  - Added the boulder spell effect
- Debugging
  - Added a Do Turn debug function to intentionally make a nop turn occur

- Bug fixes
  - Right-clicking on the Player no longer causes a NaN error with the line of sight code
- Spell changes:
  - Added ConeSpellEffect for cones in cardinal directions
  
Version 16 - 25-Oct-2011
- General
  - You must drag the mouse cursor at least 12 pixels into a tile before the Player will move. This prevents needing surgical precision to drag the Player diagonally.

- Spell changes
  - Added DiagonalConeSpellEffect for cones in diagonal directions
  - Added support for cone spells to do damage

  - Allowed Points to be constructed by passing in another Point as the first parameter to the constructor
  
Version 18 - 02-Nov-2011
- Graphics
  - Scaled tile size down to 32x32. It's a more standard size and easier to get tile graphics and makes the player and monsters look closer together when adjacent.
- Spell changes
  - The condition where a monster hits another monster with a projectile will have a proper message in the log.
- Map Generator
  - First generation of random map generator accessible via the "Map Generator" link
- General
  - Added QUnit testing library

Version 19 - 06-Nov-2011
- General
  - Fixed issue where dragging the Player into an obstacle or monster triggered multiple game turns
  - Fixed issue where dragging the Player adjacent to a monster did not result in the monster attempting to make a melee attack
  - Started using a Javascript minimizer for all script files
- Map Generator
  - Implemented more unit tests
  - Rooms will be generated at random sizes and fill the map using the "pack rooms" layout

Version 20 - 07-Nov-2011
- General
  - Streamlined some aspects of the publishing script
- Map Generator
  - More unit tests and refactoring

TODO
============
- Subclass of actor for the player?
- Area spells need to set their primary target to the last square that they were in, NOT the square where an obstacle is encountered
- Props (doors, chests, etc)
- Implement HP/mana counters for Player (i.e. no more invincibility)
- Items/inventory system
- Fog of war?
- Random map generation
- Refactor draw functions for SpellEffects (most of them are ending up being identical)
- Switch config stuff to XML from JSON
