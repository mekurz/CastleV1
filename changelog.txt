Vection 3 - 07-Apr-2011
- ViewPort class (creating tiles, loading map tiles, larger map support, shifting map, more JQuery)
- Player now uses an instance of Actor

Version 4 - 09-Apr-2011

Version 5 - 03-Jul-2011

- Monsters:
  - Added Hill Giant (oh shit!)
- Enemy AI changes:
  - Monsters will use line of sight to determine if they can see you
  - Monsters will move to attack if you are within a certain distance (Rat Mans have bad eyes)
  - Monsters that don't have line of sight or are too far away from you have a 50% chance of just wandering around
  - Certain monsters can see far and have a chance of deciding to cast a spell at you rather than move

  - Added a "Switch to Random Map" button to demonstrate large maps. Only two tiles are currently used in the conversion step right now.
    - Things look a little funny since certain tiles are meant to hold doors eventually, and the switch process can get you stuck inside a wall. Keep clicking until it works.

TODO
============
- Area spells need to set their primary target to the last square that they were in, NOT the square where an obstacle is encountered
- Props (traps, chests, etc)
- Implement HP/mana counters for Player (i.e. no more invincibility)
- Item stats, etc
- Dungeon map (scaled down version of the full map)
- Items in the inventory need detailed tooltips
- Rings need to be handled as a special item for multiple slots
- Tooltips need to be split into two sections (one for detection and one for seeing/map showing)... split off num_items?
- Spawn monsters/items inside rooms
- Look into reducing the number of tunnels or make the map size smaller
- Enhance doors (don't draw when not explored, break when hit with a spell?)
- Open/Close verbs
- Create a common function for determining random chances of stuff
